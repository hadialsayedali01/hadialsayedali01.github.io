									<p style="font-style:normal">I am a data analyst located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. I completed an Honours BSc with Major in Mathematics and Minor in Professional Writing at the University of Ottawa in 2023, and I often look for mathematically based solutions in my everyday work. Usually, the more mathematically based a concept is, the easier I can understand it. I intend to continue my mathematics education as it pertains to data science; currently, I am reading about <a target="_blank" href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HilbertSpace.html">Hilbert spaces</a>. My secondary background in writing has taught me how to translate complicated technical information into comprehensible and interesting content for general audiences.
                                        <br><br>
                                        I first began using Python regularly in high school (to calculate my GPA, since I tired of doing it manually), and I now use its various data science libraries on a regular basis. Python is often primary in my work and personal projects, but I enjoy learning and applying new tools as well. SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and JavaScript are additional tools I use regularly.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I am interested in finding insights in datasets that consist of average, passive experiences, such as driving. These insights might sometimes be obvious, but I've found that's the case only because of how prevalent they are. Making explicit the connections between these insights and their massive impacts can encourage more proactivity in how we approach daily, "boring" experiences, whether that is on a collective, policy-deciding scale or that of an individual person. 
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I am also deeply invested in uncovering instances of large-scale bias and how it can account for surprising outcomes: Cathy O'Neil's "Weapons of Math Destruction" highlights highly specific patterns that reveal large-scale, ongoing racial division issues in the United States. There is also the question of whether machine learning techniques tend to remove human bias or perpetuate it, which has been an issue in generative AI recently and is explored by O'Neil.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        My other interests are quite broad: I regularly watch soccer (favourite team: Tottenham Hotspur) and movies, and enjoy going on long, mind-clearing walks. One of my goals is to eventually walk across a large portion of Canada.</p>
